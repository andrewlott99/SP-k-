# SP-k-
These diagrams, along with Freiman's 3k-4 theorem, prove SP(k)=3k-3 for k=4,5,6,7. 
They represent the product sets of subsets of small arithmetic progressions of the form {x,x+d,x+2d,...,x+sd}. 
Each entry in a diagram is an ordered pair denoting the coefficient of xd and the coefficient of d^2. 
Each diagram is marked with a path indicating a strictly increasing sequence of at least 3k-3 products.
